LevelSet was a Stanford Treehacks Hackathon project that developed a monitoring suite that would detect micro-aggressions or other racist comments said during meetings or in chat and then aggregate and graph the aggressiveness of a conversation in a digital hub. LevelSet won best decision making under uncertainty from Citadel Securities.
